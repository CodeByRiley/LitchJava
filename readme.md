# LitchJava

An LWJGL toy project.

## Core Features

### Graphics Engine
- Advanced rendering pipeline with GLSL shader integration
- Batched rendering system for optimized performance
- Primitive shape rendering (rectangles, circles, lines)
- Flexible UI framework with buttons, labels, and panels
- Text rendering system
- OpenGL-based graphics with error handling and monitoring

### Scene Management
- Scene-based architecture for game state management
- Demo scene showcasing rendering capabilities
- Flexible scene transitions and state handling

### Input System
- Mouse input handling with position and button state tracking
- Keyboard input system
- Event-based input processing

### Development Tools
- Comprehensive logging system with multiple severity levels:
  - Multiple output channels (console and file)
  - Performance-oriented logging with frame-based suppression
  - OpenGL error checking and debugging
  - Configurable log levels (trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal)
